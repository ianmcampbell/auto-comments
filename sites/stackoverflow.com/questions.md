###[Q] Homework (R)
$SITENAME$ is not a homework or work task tutoring site nor is it a tutorial site. That said, if you try to address the problem yourself and get stuck, many here are willing to help. Please [edit] your question with what you have tried so far and the specific issue you are having. See [How do I ask and answer homework questions?](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/334822/how-do-i-ask-and-answer-homework-questions) and [How to make a great R reproducible example](https://$SITEURL$/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example) for more.

###[Q] You need a tutorial (R)
It seems that you have fundamental gaps in your knowledge of the R programming language and would instead benefit more from reading a tutorial or asking your instructor if you are participating in a class. See the [R tag wiki](https://$SITEURL$/tags/r/info) for some great resources.
