###[A] New Question / Clarification
Please do not post answers to ask for clarification or pose a different question. All posts placed in the answer box [are expected to address the question posted at the top of the page](//$SITEURL$/help/deleted-answers). If you have a *different* question, you can [search](//$SITEURL$/search) for other questions, or refer to the related and linked questions on the right-hand side of the page. If that fails, you can [ask a new question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask), and include a link to this one to help provide context.

###[A] Me Too
Please do not post an answer to say "I have this question too." All answers [are expected to address the question posted at the top of the page](//$SITEURL$/help/deleted-answers). You can click the "Follow" link under the question to be [notified of updates](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/345661/). You can [search](//$SITEURL$/search) for other questions, or refer to the related and linked questions on the right-hand side of the page. Earn a bit more reputation and you may also [upvote](//$SITEURL$/privileges/vote-up) the question to indicate your interest.

###[A] Answers just to say Thanks!
Please don't add "thanks" as answers. Invest some time in the site and you will gain sufficient [privileges](//$SITEURL$/privileges) to upvote answers you like, which is the $SITENAME$ way of saying thank you.

###[A] Nothing but a URL (and isn't spam)
Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference.

###[A] Requests to OP for further information
This is really a comment, not an answer. With a bit more rep, [you will be able to post comments](//$SITEURL$/privileges/comment). For the moment I've added the comment for you, and I'm flagging this post for deletion.

###[A] OP using an answer for further information
Please use the *Post answer* button only for actual answers. You should modify your original question to add additional information.

###[A] OP adding a new question as an answer
If you have another question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) button.

###[A] Another user adding a "Me too!"
If you have a NEW question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) button. If you have sufficient reputation, [you may upvote](//$SITEURL$/privileges/vote-up) the question. Alternatively, "star" it as a favorite and you will be notified of any new answers.

###[A] No disclosure
When you post answers with links to resources with which you have an affiliation, [you are expected](https://$SITEURL$/help/behavior) to disclose that affiliation in the post. Please [edit] your answer to include your affiliation. Otherwise your post may be deleted. Please also have a look at [How not to be a spammer](https://$SITEURL$/help/promotion).
