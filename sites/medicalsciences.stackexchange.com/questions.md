###[Q] Medical Advice
Questions requesting personal medical advice are off-topic here. It would be inappropriate for anyone to attempt to address your health issues. Such questions should be taken to your personal physician who can examine you and access your full medical records. For more information, please see [this meta post](https://medicalsciences.meta.stackexchange.com/a/748/805).
